I found this project very difficult for myself, thankfully I had help with the javascript which is the bane of my coding existence, but I cannot figure out for the life of me what the error with it is. I can not get the html and javascript to talk to eachother efficiently, I am going to continue watching videos on javascript and come back to this later. I just need to get the assignments in now, so I can receive my certificate, been working on this one since 7pm yesterday and need to move on.
